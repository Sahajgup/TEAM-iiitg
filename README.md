# PACE2024O
This solver converts the OSCM problem into an Integer Linear Programming Optimization problem. We use CBC solver to solve the ILP. We apply a few optimmizations as preprocessing steps before passing it on to the solver along with constraints and an objective to minimize the number of crossings.


# Requirements
This solver requires ortools library.
